# Optimizing Bus Route Frequency Using Real-Time Ridership Data and Predictive Modeling

## Overview

This project analyzes real-time bus ridership data to optimize bus route frequencies within a city.  The goal is to improve service efficiency by maximizing ridership while minimizing operational costs.  The analysis leverages predictive modeling techniques to forecast future ridership demands and proposes optimized route schedules based on these predictions.  This involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, predictive model training, and the generation of actionable recommendations for bus route adjustments.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

This project requires Python 3 and several Python libraries.  To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the main analysis script using:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the analysis to the console, including:

* Summary statistics of the ridership data.
* Performance metrics of the predictive model.
* Proposed adjustments to bus route frequencies, including specific routes and suggested changes.

Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., plots showing ridership trends, model performance, and optimized route frequency suggestions) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations aid in understanding the analysis and its recommendations.  File names will be descriptive of their contents.


## Data

This project requires a dataset containing real-time bus ridership data.  The specific format and location of this data are not included in this repository for confidentiality reasons. A sample data structure would be expected, with at least columns representing route ID, timestamp, and passenger count.  The `data` folder (if present) may contain example data for demonstration purposes.
